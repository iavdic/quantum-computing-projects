# Analysis of Quantum Ansatz Performance for VQE as Implemented in Qiskit

This simple project evaluates the performance of different quantum ansatzes using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to compute the ground state energy of the hydrogen molecule (Hâ‚‚). It compares the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD), paired UUCD (pUCCD) and pUCCSD, symmetry-adapted UCCSD (SUCCSD), the Hardware Efficient Ansatz (HEA), and a custom ansatz in terms of accuracy.

## **Setup**
